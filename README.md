This project implements an NLP-based machine learning system that automatically classifies customer support tickets and assigns priority levels. The system combines machine learning with business rules to simulate real-world support ticket triaging.

## Features
- Text preprocessing using NLTK
- Ticket classification using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression
- Machine learning pipeline for robust predictions
- Rule-based priority assignment with explanations
- Clean and interpretable output

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn

## Example Output
Ticket: Payment failed again and refund not received  
Predicted Category: Billing  
Priority: High  
Reason: Financial impact

## Use Cases
- Customer support automation
- Helpdesk ticket routing
- NLP-based classification systems
